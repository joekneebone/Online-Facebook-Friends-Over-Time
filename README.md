Online Facebook Friends Over Time
=================================

This tool can be used to collect data that can be graphed to show the number of online Facebook friends over time.

First, run the collect.py script. This creates an output.txt file, which contains the number of your online Facebook friends, along with a timestamp. To create a graph, output.txt can be imported into Microsoft Excel, or another graphing program.

Further details can be found at the beginning of the collect.py script.
