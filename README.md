Online Facebook Friends Over Time
=================================

This tool can be used to collect data that can be graphed to show the number of online Facebook friends over time.

This tool requires that Python is installed on your computer.

First, run the collect.py script. This creates an output.txt file. Every 60 seconds, the collect.py script will output a new line to this file, which contains the number of your online Facebook friends, and a timestamp. To create a graph, output.txt can be imported into Microsoft Excel, or another graphing program.

An example graph has been included in this repository.

Further details can be found at the beginning of the collect.py script.
